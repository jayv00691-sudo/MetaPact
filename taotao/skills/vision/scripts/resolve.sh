# resolve.sh — map a Feishu image_key (or file_key) to the local inbound file path.
#
# The runtime auto-downloads inbound media to <runtime>/media/inbound/<uuid>.<ext>
# and logs "downloaded <type> media, saved to <path>" in gateway.log right after
# the message line that contains the key. We grep the key in gateway.log, then
# grab the first "saved to <path>" that follows.
#
# Usage: resolve.sh <image_key|file_key>
#        resolve.sh --latest [jpg|png|webp]   # fallback: most recent image
